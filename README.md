  - Responsibility: Count Leading Zeros implementation
- **Kelly Pierre** (triforce496@gmail.com)
  - Responsibility: Endian Swap implementation
- **Rishav R. Dahal** (email@example.com)
  - Responsibility: Rotate Right implementation
- **Isaiah Geesey** (email@example.com)
  - Responsibility: Parity implementation

## Project Description:

This program implements various bitwise operations through a clear and intuitive menu interface. The operations include:

- **Count Leading Zeros**
- **Endian Swap**
- **Rotate Right**
- **Parity Check**

Each operation is implemented using only bitwise operations in the C programming language.

## Compilation Instructions:

Compile the project using the provided Makefile:

```bash
make clean
make
./bitwisemenu.exe
